Descart is a directory website created by Eddie Kim. There seems to be no website that displays all the food carts in a user friendly manner so this website is in development to create one such helpful app. It will eventually include helpful features:
- Listing all the food carts in a certain food cart pod
- Sorting by food type
- Sorting by location
- Displaying details for each food cart like ratings from other sites, social media links, and other helpful info
- Displaying where each food cart pod or independent food cart on an interactive map
- Displaying food carts by food type on the interactive map
- Notes on updates for each food cart and a section for all updates regarding food carts
- Possible user interaction such as importing a Google Maps saved list and displaying the locations in the list and not on the list on the interactive map differentiated by icons

## Technologies
The technologies used in the development of the website were NextJS for the front end and Flask for the back end.
